# Day 3 - JavaScript Delirium

## design + performance

- steve Souders
- @souders
- speedcurve
- bring devs and design together
- obligatory venn diagram
- designers should be sitting in the same area as the front-end team
- designs need to be performant, no reckless design
- performance in design affects your page rank - is critical

### how do we get there?

- small cross-functional teams (react, hack, hhvm, jsx, xhp might be good here)
- agree on guiding principals
    - ex. speed is more important thatn design embellishment (site must run in under 2 seconds)
- site should never feel "clogged" with content
- prototype early - no designs or mocks, real data with real software, run perf tests
- live design with chrome dev tools in front of the designer and product owner
- track your performance budget and find where you can save
- surface your page data live on the page - constant reminder on what performance is happening
- surface your ga stats - bookmarklet to bring a page with all perf metrics
- window.onload is not the best metric for measuring speed
- we're trying to capture the user's perception as much as possible
- webpagetest
    - page load time
    - start recorder
    - speed index
    - start render
- **speed index** - above the fold median pixel was rendered
- filmstrips
- video

### custom metrics

- what matters most to the user in your application
- User Timing Spec!
- ex. time to first tweet
- performance.getEntriesByName("hero.jpg")[0].duration - network activity end NOT render end
- image onload handler? NOPE - still not exactly when the image displays on the page
- offsetHeight polling - NOPE
- inlinescript after your image tag - YES finally we get the correct result for when the image actually shows
- but wait, if the image is really slow the inline script is wrong and the resource timing is correct
- take the largest metric to get the right value
- **design for performance by lara hogan book**

## Responsive design, design and dev

- @divya (project manager adobe)
- entire slide presentation in photoshop
- flexible content
- why is responsive better than user agent detection
- users are on the internet more on phones than desktop
- ux, devs, client all must be happy with the design
- browser complexity makes things difficult

### search for patterns and practices to do things better

- workflow, tooling and problems
- dissatisfaction with workflows
    - increase collaboration
- love for existing design tools
    - lack of tools for collaboration
- did not like tooling updates
    - No time to learn new UI for efficient design
- it's not east to collaborate between design and development
- clients don't know what responsive design is
- hard to keep pace with changing browser featureset
- tedious to update designs for different devices

### responsive design

- define breakpoints
- design for breakpoints (snap to grid in photoshop)
- link smart objects
    - new file that is updated in all usages when used
- creative cloud extract for psd to html removes the language barrier

### avoid tedious changes

- html5please - what you can use and what's the fallback
- use popular responsive frameworks - others have already battle tested these in all the browsers on all the devices

### responsive vs adaptive

- use data to find common viewports & use

## algorithms for animations
